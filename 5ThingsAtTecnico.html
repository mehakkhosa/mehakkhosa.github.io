                                    <b>1. Theory is important, but application is everything</b><br 7>
                                    Understanding concepts like algorithms and data structures is crucial, but applying them in real-world projects or internships makes the knowledge stick. Luckily, Técnico makes the experience part easier because we are always loaded with a huge number of projects—creative, complex, and never-ending.<br 7>
                                    <b>2. Collaboration beats solo coding</b><br 7>

                                    Group projects and last-minute code nights before submission deadlines taught me that working with others is just as important as writing clean code (still working on that, though). Communication and teamwork are essential skills in tech.<br 7>
                                    
                                    <b>3. Debugging is a superpower</b><br 7>
                                    Learning how to debug effectively really saves hours of frustration! Try writing 100 print statements to debug manually—it’s the worst. Patience, logical thinking, and tools like Git, logging, and stack traces make debugging so much easier.<br 7>
                                    
                                    <b>4. Networking matters as much as coding</b><br 7>
                                    Attending tech talks, career fairs, and alumni meetups helped me realize that knowing the right people can open unexpected doors. LinkedIn, internships, and mentorships are game-changers. We should start attending these as early as the first semester!<br 7>
                                    
                                    <b>5. Enjoy the journey, not just the destination</b><br 7>

                                    University isn’t just about assignments and exams. I learned the hard way that taking breaks, hanging out with friends, and exploring hobbies (very important—you discover more about your personality!) all make a difference. The memories outside the auditorium matter just as much as the degree.
